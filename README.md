# Sign-Language-Classification
Fourth task submission at The Sync intern's
Sign language classification in machine learning involves the use of algorithms and techniques to automatically recognize and interpret sign language gestures or signs. Sign language is a visual-gestural language used by the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities to communicate. Machine learning models can be trained to recognize these gestures, enabling communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.
In this project i used a Convolution Neural Network model
